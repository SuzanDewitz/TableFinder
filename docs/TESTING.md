## Further Testing

The website underwent thorough testing to ensure it functions properly on various browsers, including Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. In addition, extensive testing was performed to ensure all links and navigation are functioning as intended.

To further validate the website's compatibility with different devices, testing was conducted using a variety of tools. These tools included responsive design testing tools, such as Responsinator and Responsivetesttool, which helped us evaluate how the website appears on different screen sizes and resolutions.

In addition, we utilized browser-based development tools like Google DevTools and Firefox Developer Tools to debug and optimize the website's performance. We also employed online validators, such as the W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator, to ensure the website adheres to industry standards for web development.

Through these testing efforts, we were able to identify and address any issues that arose, ultimately resulting in a website that functions seamlessly across multiple browsers and devices.

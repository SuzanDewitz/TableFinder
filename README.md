  # Portfolio Project 4 - TableFinder restaurant booking system
 <br>
  <br>

  # User Experience (UX)
   ## Project goals


The project goals are focused on creating an attractive and user-friendly restaurant webpage that aims to entice visitors and generate an interest in the restaurant. To achieve this goal, the website will be designed to provide visitors with general information about the restaurant, its menu offerings, and a seamless reservation system that allows them to book a table directly on the webpage.
<br>
<br>


By providing a user-friendly and intuitive booking system, the website aims to provide an excellent user experience and encourage visitors to make reservations quickly and easily. Additionally, the website will also provide a booking management admin panel for the staff members to help them manage the reservations more efficiently.
<br>
<br>
Overall, My project goals are aimed at providing an exceptional user experience to your visitors and making the booking process easy and convenient for them. By achieving these goals, you can enhance the reputation of the restaurant and attract more customers to the establishment..

   + As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to make a reservation for a table directly on the webpage.

+ Returning Visitor Goals

   + As a returning visitor to the restaurant website, my goal is to quickly access the reservation system and make a reservation for a table. I also want to be able to view any updates or changes to the menu offerings and find information on any upcoming events or promotions. I want the website to remember my previous visit and provide personalized recommendations based on my preferences.

+ Admin/Staff Goals

   + As an admin or staff member, my goal is to efficiently manage the restaurant's bookings and reservations using the admin panel provided. I want to be able to view and manage upcoming reservations, update the restaurant's availability, and manage the customer database. I also want to be able to receive notifications and alerts for any new reservations or changes to existing bookings.

     + As a frequent user, I want to be able to save my favorite menu items and view recommendations based on my preferences.
     + As a frequent user, I want to be able to earn rewards or loyalty points for my visits and reservations.
     + As a frequent user, I want to be able to provide feedback and reviews on my dining experience to help improve the restaurant's service and offerings.

+ Agile methodology
    + Our restaurant webpage project will follow the Agile methodology, which is a flexible and iterative approach to software development. This methodology emphasizes collaboration, communication, and adaptability to changing requirements.

     +  With Agile, we will break down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks and prioritize them based on their importance and value to the end-users. We will also work in short, time-boxed iterations (usually called "sprints") to continuously deliver functional and tested features.

    + To ensure effective collaboration and communication, we will hold daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, identify any roadblocks, and plan the next steps. We will also regularly engage with the stakeholders (including restaurant owners and staff) to get their feedback and incorporate their input into the project.

     + By using the Agile methodology, we can ensure that our project stays on track and meets the needs of our stakeholders. It also allows us to be more responsive to changing requirements or priorities, and to continuously improve the project based on feedback and testing.
+ Design
     + Our restaurant webpage project will be designed with a focus on user experience and visual appeal. We aim to create an inviting and seamless experience for visitors that showcases the restaurant's unique personality and offerings.

     + To achieve this, we will use a clean and modern design aesthetic that reflects the restaurant's brand identity. We will also prioritize ease of navigation and accessibility, ensuring that visitors can easily find the information they need and make a reservation with minimal effort.

    + Our design process will involve creating wireframes and prototypes to test the usability and effectiveness of our design choices. We will also incorporate user feedback throughout the design process to ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of our target audience.

     + In addition to the visual design, we will also ensure that the website is optimized for performance and accessibility. This includes using responsive design techniques to ensure that the website is functional and user-friendly on a variety of devices, and adhering to web accessibility guidelines to ensure that the website can be used by people with disabilities.

     + By prioritizing design and user experience, we aim to create a restaurant webpage that stands out from the competition and delivers an exceptional experience for our visitors.

+ Colors and Fonts:
    + Our restaurant webpage project will use a color scheme and font selection that reflect the restaurant's brand identity and evoke an elegant and upscale atmosphere.

    + The main color used throughout the website will be black, which provides a classic and timeless feel. This color will be used as the background for the website, providing a neutral and elegant canvas for the content to stand out.

    + To add a touch of sophistication and luxury, we will use gold accents for elements such as buttons, icons, symbols, links, and headings. This color choice complements the black background and enhances the premium look and feel of the webpage.

     + In terms of fonts, we will use clear and modern fonts that are easy to read and contribute to the overall elegant setting. The font selection will reflect the restaurant's brand identity and add to the overall cohesiveness of the design.

+ Images
      + The images used in the theme will be carefully curated to provide great content and presentation of the restaurant. They will serve as an enticement for the visitors and showcase the restaurant's unique personality and offerings. We will also ensure that the images are optimized for performance and accessibility, to ensure that they load quickly and can be viewed by a wide range of users.

    + By using a cohesive color scheme, font selection, and image curation, we aim to create a visually appealing and engaging restaurant webpage that captures the attention of our visitors and reflects the restaurant's brand identity.

+ Wireframes

   
    + Wireframes are an essential step in the design process for any website. They provide a visual representation of the website's layout, content, and functionality, allowing for early feedback and iterations before the actual design process begins.

    + For our restaurant webpage project, we have created wireframes that outline the key elements and functionality of the website. These wireframes include the homepage, menu page, reservation page, about us page, and contact page.

    +  The wireframes for the homepage show the layout and placement of key elements such as the logo, navigation menu, call-to-action buttons, and featured images. The wireframes for the menu page show the organization of the menu items, pricing, and images. The wireframes for the reservation page show the form fields and steps required to make a reservation. The wireframes for the about us page show the layout of the content and images that provide information about the restaurant's history, team, and mission. The wireframes for the contact page show the form fields and contact information required for visitors to get in touch with the restaurant.

   + These wireframes have been created with a focus on user experience, ensuring that the website is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and provides the necessary information for visitors to make reservations and learn about the restaurant. Once the wireframes have been approved, we will move on to the design process, using these wireframes as a foundation for the final design.

Welcome Suzan Dewitz,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!

## Deployment

### Deploying with Heroku

I followed the below steps using the Code Institute walkthrough:

+ The following command in the Gitpod CLI will create the relevant files needed for Heroku to install your project dependencies pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt. Please note this file should be added to a .gitignore file to prevent the file from being committed.

   1. Go to [Heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and log in; if you do not already have an account then you will need to create one.
   2. Click the New dropdown and select Create New App.
   3. Enter a name for your new project, all Heroku apps need to have a unique name, you will be prompted if you need to change it.
   4. Select the region you are working in.

### Heroku Settings
+ You will need to set your Environment Variables - this is a key step to ensuring your application is deployed properly.

  1. In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and set the following variables:

     - Add key: PORT & value 8000
     - Add key: DATABASE_URL, this should have been created automatically by Heroku.
     - Add key: CLOUDINARY_URL and the value as your cloudinary API Environment variable e.g.
     - Add key: SECRET_KEY and the value as a complex string which will be used to provide cryptographic signing.
  2. Buildpacks are also required for proper deployment, simply click Add buildpack and search for the ones that you require.
     - For this project, I needed to add Python.

### Heroku Deployment

<br>

#### In the Deploy tab:

1. Connect your Heroku account to your Github Repository following these steps:
   - Click on the Deploy tab and choose Github-Connect to Github.
   - Enter the GitHub repository name and click on Search.
   - Choose the correct repository for your application and click on Connect.
2. I can then choose to deploy the project manually or automatically, automatic deployment will generate a new application every time you push a change to Github,
   whereas manual deployment requires you to push the Deploy Branch button whenever you want a change made.
3. Once you have chosen your deployment method and have clicked Deploy Branch your application will be built and you should now see the View button, click this to open your application.

<br>

## Forking the GitHub Repository

<br>

 To use this code and make changes without affecting the original code, it is possible to 'fork' the code on the GitHub repository through the following steps:

   1. Create or log into your GitHub account.
   2. Go to the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/SuzanDewitz/TableFinder).
   3. Click the 'Fork' button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. A copy of the repository will be available in your own repository.

<br>

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. Under the repository name choose button "Code", click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open your development editor of choice and open a terminal window in a directory of your choice
Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
- > git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

+ Press Enter.

 + My goal is creating the Restaurant Booking System was to build a high-quality, user-friendly platform that would streamline the process of making restaurant reservations. 
   I drew inspiration from several sources, including:
   - The Hello Django project
   - The I Think Therefore I Blog project
   - The user experience and design aesthetic of popular reservation systems like OpenTable and Resy
   - The latest trends in web development, including responsive design and real-time updates
   - The open-source community and the many resources available for building scalable web applications
 + The system would meet the needs of both parties. By leveraging these sources of inspiration,I aimed to create a best-in-class platform that would make
   restaurant bookings easier and more enjoyable for everyone involved.

# Content

   + The restaurant booking system is built entirely with Bootstrap, a popular front-end web development framework. I used Bootstrap's pre-designed components
     and templates to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the customers.

   + By leveraging Bootstrap's powerful CSS and JavaScript components, I were able to create a cohesive design language across the entire website. 
     This helped to ensure that the user experience is consistent and intuitive, regardless of which page the user is on.

   + Additionally, I customized certain aspects of the design to fit the specific branding and content needs. For example, 
    I used Bootstrap's form components to create a reservation form that seamlessly integrates into the overall design of the website.

   + "I found that using Bootstrap allowed me to create a high-quality and professional-looking restaurant booking system in a fraction of the time it would have taken to
    develop from scratch. By utilizing the pre-built components and responsive design of Bootstrap, I was able to focus on the functionality and user experience of the system, 
    ultimately delivering a product that exceeded our client's expectations."
